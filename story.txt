CDC reporting troubling statistics that
0:02
black women are three times more likely
0:04
to die from a pregnancy related cause
0:05
than white women this disparity is a
0:08
concern for many black expecting mothers
0:10
in their families as black maternal
0:11
Health Week comes to a close we wanted
0:13
to discuss this issue with a
0:15
professional so joining us is Dr Donna
0:17
Neil an OBGYN and Maternal Fetal
0:20
Medicine specialist with the University
0:22
of Maryland Capital Region Health System
0:25
thanks for joining us Dr Neil So that
0:27
statistic why do you think that is it's
0:29
so troubling to hear that that black
0:31
women are three times more likely to die
0:34
from a pregnancy related cause why do
0:35
you think that is well it's first of all
0:38
it's very troubling uh second of all
0:40
it's multifactorial so there's no one
0:43
fix for it um so this week is so
0:46
important um because it does uplift the
0:48
problem um so everybody's talking about
0:50
it but just acknowledging the problem is
0:53
not enough but allows us then to move
0:54
forward to think about how how can we
0:56
correct the problem so as you said three
0:58
times more likely what's being done to
0:59
change that I know it's a huge issue
1:02
right because it is multifactorial lots
1:04
of initiatives have been put into play
1:05
so the first thing is the recognition of
1:07
the problem um second thing that's going
1:09
on is trying to U make sure all women
1:11
have access to care and not just Health
1:13
Care as a basis but excellent Healthcare
1:17
um thirdly there's a big big focus on
1:19
this this this concept of implicit bias
1:22
in the sense that when black and brown
1:23
women present for for their maternity
1:25
care women are not taken seriously their
1:28
complaints are not taken seriously and
1:29
does that the question is does that lend
1:31
to them their poor outcome there's also
1:33
an an effort to increase the workforce
1:35
to make them Workforce board diverse
1:37
because we know there's a lot of work
1:39
looking at what's the relationship
1:41
between the patient and their provider
1:43
particularly when the provider looks
1:44
like the patient and will have some
1:46
cultural confidence uh as their patient
1:49
um there's you know looking genetics
1:51
like what's the stress of being black in
1:53
America we know stress can have what we
1:55
call epigenetic effect so we all are
1:58
genetically the same but we the
2:00
stressors that we meet along our path of
2:02
Life can change that genetic material so
2:04
is that another reason why black women
2:06
are more at risk for some of the adverse
2:08
outcomes that we can see in pregnancy um
2:11
and then we're also looking at
2:12
environmental stress you know when we
2:14
look historically at many black and
2:15
brown communities they are in
2:16
communities that have poor um air
2:19
quality poor water sources poor land
2:22
sources um so there's a lot you know
2:25
this is again it's a snippet of what's
2:26
going on because um again it is it's
2:29
such a multifactorial problem we really
2:32
need
2:33
to understand that because there's no
2:35
one quick fix right so how does the
2:38
issues show up locally here in Prince
2:40
George's County um so I'm really first
2:43
thank you for having me I'm excited
2:45
again I am um a maternal feral medicine
2:47
specialist from the University of
2:48
Maryland uh and but I work locally here
2:51
at the new University of Maryland
2:52
Capital Region Medical Center um and
2:54
when we I I was previously working at
2:57
Hopkins and everything was great at
2:58
Hopkins but working with the Maryland
3:01
maternal uh task force uh in our state
3:04
looking at maternal Health we realize
3:06
that our state of Maryland our
3:07
Progressive state of Maryland we
3:09
actually have maternal deserts where
3:11
women don't have access to a high-risk
3:13
obstetrician like myself or even a
3:15
general obgy in and unfortunately
3:18
surprisingly for many Prince Georges
3:20
county is one of those counties um so
3:22
there's a great new hospital um right
3:24
down the road from here um it's a
3:27
beautiful labor and delivery Suite Dr
3:28
Carrie Lewis is the director of Women's
3:30
Health Services there and he also is a
3:32
perinatologist and really starting good
3:33
Center but we just need more body so now
3:37
I've I'm added to that in terms of the
3:39
high risk we've started a diabetes and
3:40
pregnancy program we started a fetal
3:42
echocardiogram program we're starting a
3:44
food pharmacy at the hospital to allow
3:47
our patients to use food as medicine um
3:49
we are starting um diabetes prevention
3:51
program because diabetes is so prevalent
3:54
in the black and brown Community as in
3:55
in Prince Gees County um so lots of
3:58
exciting things happen locally to try to
4:00
address this problem because our view is
4:02
that pregnancy is really the stress test
4:04
of life and the sense of how you do in
4:06
pregnancy can dictate how you're going
4:07
to do later in life particularly
4:09
diabetes hypertension leading them to uh
4:12
cardiovascular disease in women if we
4:14
step that back even further we know how
4:16
you enter a pregnancy it's also going to
4:17
dictate how you do in the pregnancy so
4:19
there's a big focus in PR's County to
4:21
look at what we call preconceptual care
4:23
so you know optimizing you know
4:25
underlying medical conditions before a
4:26
woman even enter enters a pregnancy
4:29
understanding what is pregnancy all
4:30
about for women who might be healthy but
4:32
may not understand what are some of the
4:34
risk factors to look out that suggest
4:36
that hey there's a problem I need to
4:38
engage earlier than later so what does
4:40
someone look out for someone who may be
4:41
pregnant how do they know for example if
4:43
they're getting the best care or not um
4:45
so I think how do they know that's a
4:48
that's that's a loaded question so our
4:51
expectation is anyone who enters the
4:52
health system should be getting the best
4:54
care but how you should know I mean I
4:56
think if your physician never sits down
4:59
when there speaking with you that's a
5:01
red flag because we all need a moment to
5:03
ground ourselves to be able to listen no
5:05
matter what field we're in and one of
5:06
the keys I think to that doctor patient
5:09
relationship is listening um because our
5:11
patients tell are telling us what is
5:13
going on so if your doctor never sits
5:15
down that's not a good sign uh if your
5:17
doctor never asked you um do you have
5:20
access to the medication I'm about to
5:22
prescribe for you that's not a good sign
5:25
because again they may not be listening
5:26
to you if your doctor never tells you
5:29
how to reach them after hours because
5:31
you know as Physicians we are there's
5:34
always somebody around even though I may
5:35
not be the person on call and for
5:38
tonight but there's somebody who's
5:39
covering so if you don't know how to
5:40
reach your providers in an emergency
5:43
then that's out a good sign and if you
5:45
don't have any guidance in terms of what
5:47
would be some reasons to call in an
5:48
emergency then that's not a good sign so
5:51
those are just four I think to kind of
5:53
get
5:54
started so the county I know that does
5:57
any of this have any issues related to
5:59
income education and I say prince GE
6:01
County high education levels High income
6:04
does it say these problems are not
6:06
associated with income levels or
6:07
education levels so that is just such an
6:10
amazing question to ask because you know
6:12
historically we thought that some of
6:13
that disparities and outcomes related to
6:15
access to care lack of Education uh lack
6:19
of socioeconomic uh resources but the
6:22
unfortunate thing is that when we
6:24
control for social economics education
6:27
attainment zip code black women's still
6:29
do worse than white women so my white
6:31
college roommate or my white medical
6:33
student roommate or my white Fellowship
6:35
roommate will do better in pregnancy
6:37
than me so that just tells us it's not
6:39
just access to care there's that you
6:41
know there's more to this story and
6:42
that's again where's maybe the the
6:44
impact of stress and epigenetics comes
6:46
into play okay Doctor a lot to think
6:48
about thank you for coming appreciate it
